# About
This is a project built to tribute the now dead "CHGM" genre in K-Pop.
Also, this is my first project using React and Next.
This project includes a heardle game for CHGM songs, and a list page for CHGM songs, artists, and albums.
You can check out the project [here](https://chgm.vercel.app/).


### What is chgm?
It's a reference to a hilarious YouTube video claiming [these kinds of songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2FONa0A7EaSDvAgck02s5s?si=58599d12695c4706) as "CHGM songs" because genre didn't have any specific name before, I stuck with CHGM for this project's name.
